### Hi there 👋

I'm Michaela Bickish. I have a background in business operations and finance with a new passion for software development.

I enjoy creating improved & efficient solutions that make everyone happier!
I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look fantastic.
